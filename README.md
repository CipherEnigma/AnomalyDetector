# Chest X-ray Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest

## Objective
Detect anomalies in chest X-ray images using unsupervised learning (Isolation Forest).

## Approach
- Extracted features from chest X-ray images.
- Trained Isolation Forest to separate normal and anomalous images.
- Evaluated model using ROC-AUC scores and sample visualizations.

## Highlights
- No labeled data required.
- Visualization of anomalous predictions.
- Potential extension: deep learning-based feature extraction.

## Requirements
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- opencv-python
